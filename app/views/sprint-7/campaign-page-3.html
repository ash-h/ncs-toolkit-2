          <h2>How the skills toolkit can help</h2>

          <p>One in three people have used online learning to help them get a better job. On average, online learning can boost your annual pay by £3,640 too.
          </p>
          <p>Build your skills in your own time and on your own terms, with The Skills Toolkit.</p>

          <h3>Learn the basics, or refresh the fundamentals</h3>
          <p>82% of all jobs require basic digital skills, such as using the internet or office programs like Microsoft Word. And the cost of poor numeracy to the UK economy is £20 billion a year.</p>
          <p>Some of us haven’t thought about maths since secondary school. Others have never quite got the hang of using a computer. With The Skills Toolkit, you can brush up on both in your own time. For free. </p>
          <h3>Digital skills pay more, and are in demand</h3>
          <p>Salaries for more specialised digital roles tend to be 36% higher than average. In recent years, the number of digital jobs grew almost three times as quickly as other occupations.</p>
          <p>The Skills Toolkit offers a range of in-demand digital skills, including:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>Data Analysis</li>
              <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
              <li>User Experience Design</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These are in LinkedIn’s top 5 most in-demand hard skills. Learn them for free, with The Skills Toolkit. </p>
          <h3>Boost your CV</h3>
          <p>A recent LinkedIn survey showed that more than half of the senior leaders and managers surveyed identified soft skills - like leadership, problem solving and project management - as their number one development priority.</p>
          <p>The Skills Toolkit offers a range of short courses on:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>networking</li>
